FenceChat
=========

Enter a chatroom when you enter an actual room.

This README is just a plan/design document for the actual app.

## You don't have to manually join any chatrooms
The app uses geolocation to find out where you are, and automatically adds you to chat rooms in that area.

## Preventing Abuse
Each user can only create a certain number of square meters of chatroom, to prevent people from blanketing all of SF in one chatroom. Or maybe there is a maximum number of rooms per user, and each room is 100sq meters max.

## Talk to other people who are interested in a location
When you have been added to a chatroom, you can Pin it, so that you can come back to it later. That way if you and some other people were at an event, you can keep chatting about it after.

## Projector display
If you're running an event, display your event's FenceChat on the wall so that people can be up to date without having to take out their phones.

## Multiple plaforms
Using Meteor's PhoneGap integration, the app will run on iOS and Android primarily and also on desktop web and mobile web.
